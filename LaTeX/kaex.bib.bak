	abstract = {Phage display, the presentation of (poly)peptides as fusions to capsid proteins on the surface of bacterial viruses, celebrates its 25th birthday in 2010. The technique, coupled with in vitro selection, enables rapid identiﬁcation and optimization of proteins based on their structural or functional properties. In the last two decades, it has advanced tremendously and has become widely accepted by the scientiﬁc community. This by no means exhaustive review aims to inform the reader of the key modiﬁcations in phage display. Novel display formats, innovative library designs and screening strategies are discussed. I will also brieﬂy review some recent uses of the technology to illustrate its incredible versatility.},

	abstract = {Binding proteins are typically isolated from combinatorial libraries of scaffold proteins using one of the many library screening tools available, such as phage display, yeast surface display or {mRNA} display. A key principle underlying these screening technologies is the establishment of a link between each unique mutant protein and its corresponding genetic code. The mutant proteins binding a desired target species are separated and subsequently identiﬁed using the genetic code. In this review, we largely focus on the use of yeast surface display for the isolation of binding proteins from combinatorial libraries. In yeast surface display, the yeast cell links the mutant protein to its coding {DNA}. Each yeast cell expresses the mutant proteins as fusions to a yeast cell wall protein; the yeast cell also carries plasmid {DNA} that codes for the mutant protein. Over the years, the yeast surface display platform has emerged as a powerful tool for protein engineering, and has been used in a variety of applications including afﬁnity maturation, epitope mapping and biophysical characterization of proteins. Here we present a broad overview of the yeast surface display system and its applications, and compare it with other contemporary screening platforms. Further, we present detailed protocols for the use of yeast surface display to isolate de novo binding proteins from combinatorial libraries, and subsequent biophysical characterization of binders. These protocols can also be easily modiﬁed for afﬁnity maturation of the isolated de novo binders.},

	abstract = {The {HER}3 receptor is implicated in the progression of various cancers as well as in resistance to several currently used drugs, and is hence a potential target for development of new therapies. We have previously generated Affibody molecules that inhibit heregulin-induced signaling of the {HER}3 pathways. The aim of this study was to improve the affinity of the binders to hopefully increase receptor inhibition efficacy and enable a high receptor-mediated uptake in tumors. We explored a novel strategy for affinity maturation of Affibody molecules that is based on alanine scanning followed by design of library diversification to mimic the result from an error-prone {PCR} reaction, but with full control over mutated positions and thus less biases. Using bacterial surface display and flow-cytometric sorting of the maturation library, the affinity for {HER}3 was improved more than 30-fold down to 21 {pM}. The affinity is among the higher that has been reported for Affibody molecules and we believe that the maturation strategy should be generally applicable for improvement of affinity proteins. The new binders also demonstrated an improved thermal stability as well as complete refolding after denaturation. Moreover, inhibition of ligand-induced proliferation of {HER}3-positive breast cancer cells was improved more than two orders of magnitude compared to the previously best-performing clone. Radiolabeled Affibody molecules showed specific targeting of a number of {HER}3-positive cell lines in vitro as well as targeting of {HER}3 in in vivo mouse models and represent promising candidates for future development of targeted therapies and diagnostics.},

In the last decade, developments in the field of biomolecular engineering and crosslinker chemistry have greatly influenced the development of this field. With all these new approaches at our disposal, several new immobilization methods have been created to address the main challenges associated with immobilized antibodies. Few of these challenges that we have discussed in this review are mainly associated to the site-specific immobilization, appropriate orientation, and activity retention. We have discussed the effect of antibody immobilization approaches on the parameters on the performance of an immunoassay.},
